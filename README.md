 **In this activity, you will create the code that a candy store will use in their state-of-the-art candy vending machine.**

        Instructions
        1. Create a loop that prints all of the candies in the store to the terminal, with their index stored in brackets beside them.

        # For example: "[0] Snickers"
        2.Create a second loop that runs for a set number of times determined by the variable allowance.

        # For example: If allowance is equal to five, the loop should run five times.

        3. Each time this second loop runs, take in a user's input, preferably a number, and then add the candy with the matching index to the variable candy_cart.

        # For example: If the user enters "0" as their input, "Snickers" should be added into the candy_cart list.

        4. Use another loop to print all of the candies selected to the terminal.

        # Bonus
        # Create a version of the code that allows a user to select as much candy as they want until they say they do not want any more.
